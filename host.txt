# Added by Docker Desktop
# To allow the same kube context to work on the host and the container:
127.0.0.1 kubernetes.docker.internal
# End of section

# This entry was appended by Docker Desktop because `localhost` did not resolve
# to a list of addresses which included 127.0.0.1. This can happen due to a bug
# in the macOS migration assistant, or possibly because another tool has
# corrupted the file.
